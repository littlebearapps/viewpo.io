        <h2 class="font-heading font-semibold text-2xl mt-12 mb-4">Overview</h2>
        <p class="text-foreground/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Viewpo is operated by Little Bear Apps ABN [TBA]. By using Viewpo (the "Service"), you agree to these terms. If you don't agree, please don't use the Service.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-heading font-semibold text-2xl mt-12 mb-4">Beta programme</h2>

        </p>
        <ul class="text-foreground/70 space-y-2 mb-6 list-disc pl-6">

          <li>Features may change, be added, or be removed without notice</li>
          <li>The Service may experience downtime for maintenance or updates</li>
          <li>There is no service level agreement (SLA) during beta</li>
          <li>We may limit beta access at our discretion</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-foreground/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          By joining the beta, you understand that the Service is under active development and may not work perfectly. Your feedback helps us improve — and we appreciate it.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-heading font-semibold text-2xl mt-12 mb-4">Provider connections</h2>
        <p class="text-foreground/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          When you connect a hosting provider (Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify), you authorise Viewpo to access your deployment previews using the permissions granted through OAuth. You can revoke this access at any time through your provider's settings or within the Viewpo app.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-heading font-semibold text-2xl mt-12 mb-4">Intellectual property</h2>
        <p class="text-foreground/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          You retain all rights to your content and deployments. Viewpo doesn't claim any ownership over the websites you preview. The Viewpo name, logo, and Service are the property of Little Bear Apps.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-heading font-semibold text-2xl mt-12 mb-4">Pricing and payments</h2>
        <p class="text-foreground/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          During beta, the Service is free. When paid plans launch, we'll provide at least 30 days' notice before any charges begin. Free-tier features will remain free. Prices are listed in USD and may be subject to local taxes.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-heading font-semibold text-2xl mt-12 mb-4">Termination</h2>
        <ul class="text-foreground/70 space-y-2 mb-6 list-disc pl-6">
          <li>You can delete your account at any time through the app</li>
          <li>We may suspend or terminate your account if you violate these terms</li>
          <li>Upon termination, your data will be deleted within 30 days</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="font-heading font-semibold text-2xl mt-12 mb-4">Limitation of liability</h2>
        <p class="text-foreground/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The Service is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Little Bear Apps is not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the Service. Our total liability is limited to the amount you've paid us in the 12 months before the claim.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-heading font-semibold text-2xl mt-12 mb-4">Changes to these terms</h2>
        <p class="text-foreground/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          We may update these terms from time to time. We'll notify you of significant changes by email or by posting a notice on the website. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-heading font-semibold text-2xl mt-12 mb-4">Governing law</h2>
        <p class="text-foreground/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">
