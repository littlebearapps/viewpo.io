        <p class="text-foreground/50 text-sm mb-12">Last updated: 16 February 2026</p>

        <h2 class="font-heading font-semibold text-2xl mt-12 mb-4">Overview</h2>
        <p class="text-foreground/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Viewpo is operated by Little Bear Apps ABN 32 380 848 852. By using Viewpo (the "Service"), you agree to these terms. If you don't agree, please don't use the Service.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-heading font-semibold text-2xl mt-12 mb-4">Beta programme</h2>
        <p class="text-foreground/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Viewpo is currently in beta. During the beta period:
        </p>
        <ul class="text-foreground/70 space-y-2 mb-6 list-disc pl-6">
          <li>The Service is provided free of charge</li>
          <li>Features may change, be added, or be removed without notice</li>
          <li>The Service may experience downtime for maintenance or updates</li>
          <li>There is no service level agreement (SLA) during beta</li>
          <li>We may limit beta access at our discretion</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-foreground/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          By joining the beta, you understand that the Service is under active development and may not work perfectly. Your feedback helps us improve — and we appreciate it.
        </p>
        <p class="text-foreground/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          When the beta period ends, we will notify you at least 14 days in advance. Data created during beta will carry over to your account. If we update these Terms for general availability, we will ask you to accept the updated Terms before continuing to use the Service.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-heading font-semibold text-2xl mt-12 mb-4">Service modifications</h2>
        <p class="text-foreground/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          We continuously improve Viewpo. For free and beta users, features may change, be added, or be removed without notice. For paid subscribers, we will provide at least 30 days' notice of any material changes that significantly reduce the functionality included in your plan. If you do not agree to the changes, you may cancel your subscription and receive a pro-rata refund for any unused time in your current billing period.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-heading font-semibold text-2xl mt-12 mb-4">Your account</h2>
        <ul class="text-foreground/70 space-y-2 mb-6 list-disc pl-6">
          <li>You must provide accurate information when creating an account</li>
          <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account</li>
          <li>You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service</li>
          <li>One person or organisation per account (no shared accounts)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="font-heading font-semibold text-2xl mt-12 mb-4">Acceptable use</h2>
        <p class="text-foreground/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          You agree not to:
        </p>
        <ul class="text-foreground/70 space-y-2 mb-6 list-disc pl-6">
          <li>Use the Service to access content you don't have permission to view</li>
          <li>Attempt to circumvent access controls or security measures</li>
          <li>Use the Service to scrape, mirror, or redistribute website content</li>
          <li>Share your account credentials with others</li>
          <li>Use the Service in any way that violates applicable laws</li>
          <li>Intentionally overload or disrupt the Service</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="font-heading font-semibold text-2xl mt-12 mb-4">Provider connections</h2>
        <p class="text-foreground/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          When you connect a hosting provider (Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify), you authorise Viewpo to access your deployment previews using the permissions granted through OAuth. You can revoke this access at any time through your provider's settings or within the Viewpo app.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-heading font-semibold text-2xl mt-12 mb-4">Intellectual property</h2>
        <p class="text-foreground/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          You retain all rights to your content and deployments. Viewpo doesn't claim any ownership over the websites you preview. The Viewpo name, logo, and Service are the property of Little Bear Apps.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-heading font-semibold text-2xl mt-12 mb-4">Pricing and payments</h2>
        <p class="text-foreground/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          During beta, the Service is free. When paid plans launch, we will provide at least 30 days' notice before any charges begin. Free-tier features will remain free.
        </p>
        <p class="text-foreground/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Paid subscriptions are processed by our online reseller, <a href="https://www.lemonsqueezy.com" class="text-links hover:text-primary transition-colors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lemon Squeezy</a>, who acts as the Merchant of Record for all purchases. When you purchase a subscription, your payment relationship is with Lemon Squeezy, subject to their <a href="https://www.lemonsqueezy.com/terms" class="text-links hover:text-primary transition-colors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://www.lemonsqueezy.com/privacy" class="text-links hover:text-primary transition-colors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a>.

        </p>
        <p class="text-foreground/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Prices are listed in USD. Local taxes are calculated and added at checkout by Lemon Squeezy based on your location. You may request refunds through Lemon Squeezy's process or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@littlebearapps.com" class="text-links hover:text-primary transition-colors">support@littlebearapps.com</a>. We may change pricing with at least 30 days' notice. Price changes do not apply to the current billing period.
        </p>
        <p class="text-foreground/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Paid subscriptions renew automatically at the end of each billing period unless you cancel before the renewal date. You can cancel at any time through the Viewpo app or by contacting <a href="mailto:support@littlebearapps.com" class="text-links hover:text-primary transition-colors">support@littlebearapps.com</a>. Cancellation takes effect at the end of your current billing period — you retain access until then.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-heading font-semibold text-2xl mt-12 mb-4">Termination</h2>
        <ul class="text-foreground/70 space-y-2 mb-6 list-disc pl-6">
          <li>You can delete your account at any time through the app</li>
          <li>We may suspend or terminate your account if you violate these terms</li>
          <li>Upon termination, your data will be deleted within 30 days</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="font-heading font-semibold text-2xl mt-12 mb-4">Limitation of liability</h2>
        <p class="text-foreground/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Nothing in these Terms excludes, restricts, or modifies any guarantee, right, or remedy that cannot be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law (ACL) or any other applicable law.
        </p>
        <p class="text-foreground/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          To the extent permitted by law, our liability for a breach of a non-excludable guarantee is limited, at our option, to: (a) the resupply of the services; or (b) the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again.
        </p>
        <p class="text-foreground/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Subject to the above, Little Bear Apps is not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the Service. Our total liability for all claims is limited to the amount you have paid us in the 12 months before the claim arose, or AUD $100, whichever is greater.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-heading font-semibold text-2xl mt-12 mb-4">Changes to these terms</h2>
        <p class="text-foreground/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          We may update these terms from time to time. We'll notify you of significant changes by email or by posting a notice on the website. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-heading font-semibold text-2xl mt-12 mb-4">Governing law</h2>
        <p class="text-foreground/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          These terms are governed by the laws of New South Wales, Australia. Any disputes will be resolved in the courts of New South Wales.
        </p>
