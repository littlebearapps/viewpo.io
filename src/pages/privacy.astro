        <p class="text-foreground/50 text-sm mb-12">Last updated: 16 February 2026</p>

        <h2 class="font-heading font-semibold text-2xl mt-12 mb-4">Who we are</h2>
        <p class="text-foreground/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Viewpo is built by <a href="https://littlebearapps.com" class="text-links hover:text-primary transition-colors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Little Bear Apps</a>, an Australian indie software studio. We build practical, privacy-friendly developer tools.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-heading font-semibold text-2xl mt-12 mb-4">What data we collect</h2>

        <h3 class="font-heading font-semibold text-xl mt-8 mb-3">Website (viewpo.io)</h3>
        <ul class="text-foreground/70 space-y-2 mb-6 list-disc pl-6">
          <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> We use <a href="https://plausible.io" class="text-links hover:text-primary transition-colors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plausible Analytics</a>, a privacy-first analytics tool. It collects no personal data, uses no cookies, and is fully GDPR-compliant. We see aggregate page views, referrers, and device types — nothing that identifies you.</li>
          <li><strong>Email address:</strong> If you sign up for the beta or waitlist, we collect your email address to send you launch notifications and beta access details. We don't sell, share, or use your email for anything else.</li>
          <li><strong>Ad measurement:</strong> If you arrive via a paid ad (e.g. Google Ads), the ad platform appends a click identifier to the URL. We store this identifier alongside your signup so we can measure which ads lead to signups. No advertising cookies are set, no third-party tracking scripts are loaded, and the identifier is never shared beyond confirming that a signup occurred.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="font-heading font-semibold text-xl mt-8 mb-3">Viewpo app</h3>
        <ul class="text-foreground/70 space-y-2 mb-6 list-disc pl-6">
          <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> We use OAuth (Sign in with Apple, GitHub, Cloudflare) for secure sign-in. We never see or store your passwords. When you authenticate, we receive your email address and a unique provider identifier to create your account. Access tokens are encrypted and stored securely. We request only read-only access to list your projects and deployment URLs — we do not request write access to your code, repositories, or hosting configuration.</li>
          <li><strong>Provider access:</strong> When you link a hosting provider (Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, etc.), we request only the permissions needed to list your projects and preview deployments. We don't read, modify, or delete your code or hosting configuration.</li>
          <li><strong>Preview URLs:</strong> Viewpo accesses your deployment preview URLs to render them in the viewport viewer. These URLs are only visible to you and anyone you explicitly share them with.</li>
          <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> We may collect anonymised usage data (features used, viewport sizes selected) to improve the app. This data is never linked to your identity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="font-heading font-semibold text-2xl mt-12 mb-4">What we don't do</h2>
        <ul class="text-foreground/70 space-y-2 mb-6 list-disc pl-6">
          <li>We don't sell your data to anyone</li>
          <li>We don't use tracking cookies</li>
          <li>We don't serve targeted advertising</li>
          <li>We don't share your data with third-party marketing platforms</li>
          <li>We don't access your source code or modify your deployments</li>
          <li>We don't act as a data broker or sell, rent, or trade your personal information to any third party for their own marketing purposes</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="font-heading font-semibold text-2xl mt-12 mb-4">Data storage and security</h2>
        <p class="text-foreground/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Your data is stored securely using industry-standard encryption in transit (TLS) and at rest. Our infrastructure is hosted on Cloudflare and Apple's cloud services. We follow security best practices and regularly review our data handling processes.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-heading font-semibold text-2xl mt-12 mb-4">Data retention</h2>
        <ul class="text-foreground/70 space-y-2 mb-6 list-disc pl-6">
          <li><strong>Account data:</strong> Deleted within 30 days of account termination</li>
          <li><strong>Backups:</strong> Encrypted backups may retain data for up to 90 days before automatic deletion</li>
          <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> Plausible analytics data is aggregate and cannot be linked to individuals. Retained indefinitely for trend analysis</li>
          <li><strong>Financial records:</strong> Transaction records are held by Lemon Squeezy (Merchant of Record) in accordance with tax compliance requirements (typically 7 years) and are not stored by Viewpo</li>
          <li><strong>Email addresses:</strong> Retained until you unsubscribe or request deletion</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="font-heading font-semibold text-2xl mt-12 mb-4">Overseas data disclosure</h2>
        <p class="text-foreground/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Your personal data may be stored and processed on servers located outside Australia, primarily in the United States and globally via Cloudflare's edge network. Our third-party service providers (Cloudflare, Lemon Squeezy) maintain data protection standards consistent with Australian Privacy Principles. By using the Service, you consent to this transfer.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-heading font-semibold text-2xl mt-12 mb-4">International data transfers</h2>
        <p class="text-foreground/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          We use service providers (Cloudflare, Lemon Squeezy) that process data in the United States and globally. These transfers are protected by Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) and, where applicable, the EU-US Data Privacy Framework. We take reasonable steps to ensure your data remains protected to the standards required by GDPR and the Australian Privacy Act.
        </p>
