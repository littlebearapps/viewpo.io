title: Getting Started with Viewpo
description: Learn how to connect your deployment provider, discover projects, and use the viewport viewer.

Viewpo brings together preview deploys from Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, Vercel, and Netlify into one dashboard. Its key feature is the viewport viewer — see how any website looks at any screen size, from any device.

## 1. Download the app

Viewpo is available on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS (via Mac Catalyst). Download it from the App Store.

:::note
Viewpo is currently in beta. [Join the TestFlight beta](https://viewpo.io/) to be among the first to try it.
:::

## 2. Connect a provider

Link your Cloudflare Pages or GitHub account with a single tap. Viewpo uses secure sign-in — no API keys, tokens, or config files needed.

1. Open Viewpo and tap **Add Provider**
2. Choose your provider (Cloudflare Pages or GitHub Pages)
3. Authorise access when prompted
4. Your projects appear automatically

:::tip
You can connect multiple providers. On the Free plan, you get 1 provider connection. Starter and Pro plans support all providers.
:::

## 3. Browse your projects

Once connected, Viewpo discovers your projects and shows them in a clean dashboard. You'll see:

- **Project name** and provider
- **Latest deploy status** (building, success, failed)
- **Branch information** for preview deploys
- **Timestamps** for when each deploy was created

## 4. Use the viewport viewer

This is where Viewpo shines. Open any deploy and tap the viewport viewer to see the site at any resolution:

- **Device presets**: iPhone 16 Pro (393×852), iPad Pro 13" (1032×1376), MacBook Pro 14" (1512×982), Desktop 27" (2560×1440)
- **Custom sizes**: Enter any width and height on Starter and Pro plans
- **Pan around**: Viewing a 27-inch desktop layout on your iPhone? Pan to see different parts of the page
- **Real rendering**: Uses a native WebView (not an iframe), so it works with any site — even those that block embedding

## 5. Share with your team

On Starter and Pro plans, generate shareable links and QR codes for any deployment:

- **Specific deploy link**: Share a point-in-time snapshot
- **Latest branch link**: Always shows the newest version for that branch
- **No account required**: Anyone with the link can view the preview
