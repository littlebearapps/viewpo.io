## General

### What is Viewpo?

Viewpo is a native app that brings together website previews from Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, Vercel, and Netlify into one dashboard. Whether you code by hand or use AI tools to build, its key feature is the viewport viewer — which lets you see how any preview looks at any screen size, from any device.

### Do I need to be a developer to use Viewpo?

No. If you deploy websites through Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify, Viewpo works for you — whether you write code yourself or use AI tools like Cursor, v0, or Bolt to build. You just need an account with one of the supported providers.

### Is Viewpo made by Little Bear Apps?

Yes! Viewpo is built by Little Bear Apps, an Australian indie software studio. We build practical, privacy-friendly developer tools.

### When does Viewpo launch?

Viewpo is currently in development. [Join the TestFlight beta](https://viewpo.io/) to be among the first to try it. Sign up to get notified when spots open up.

## Viewport Viewer

### How does the viewport viewer work?

The viewport viewer uses a native WebView (not an iframe) to load the actual website at your chosen resolution. This means it works with any site — even those that block iframe embedding. You can view a 27-inch desktop layout right on your iPhone, pan around to see different parts, and switch between device presets instantly.

### Can I really see a desktop layout on my phone?

Yes! The viewport viewer renders the actual website at your chosen resolution — whether that's a 27-inch desktop (2560x1440) or a small phone (393x852). You can pan around to see different parts of the page, just like looking through a viewfinder. It's a native WebView, so it's the real site — not a screenshot.

## Providers & Setup

### How do I connect my accounts?

Just link your Cloudflare Pages or GitHub account with a single tap — Viewpo uses secure sign-in under the hood, so there are no API keys, tokens, or config files to deal with. Once connected, it discovers your projects automatically.

### Which deployment providers are supported?

At launch, Viewpo supports Cloudflare Pages and GitHub Pages. Vercel, Netlify, and Railway support is coming soon after launch.

## Pricing & Plans

### Is there a free tier?

Yes! The free tier includes up to 3 projects, 1 provider connection, and full access to the viewport viewer at any resolution with device presets. No credit card required.

### Which platforms is Viewpo available on?

Viewpo is coming soon — launching first on iOS and iPadOS via the App Store, with macOS support via Mac Catalyst. Android, Windows, and Linux versions will follow. Sign up for the beta or get notified when it launches.

## Teams & Sharing

### Can I share preview links with my team?

Yes — on Starter and Pro plans, you can generate shareable links and QR codes for any deployment. You can share a specific deploy or a "latest for this branch" link that always shows the newest version. Team members can view and provide feedback without needing provider dashboard access.

### What does priority support mean?

Pro plan members get faster response times — within 1 business day — and a dedicated email thread for ongoing issues. Free and Starter plan members receive support within 2 business days via the same email and contact form.
